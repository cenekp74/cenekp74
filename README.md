I am a young developer from Czech Republic. I can code in Python and the html stack (css, js). I am currently learning to code in Rust. My main specialization is data processing and manipulation. 
I have a lot of experience with python in many fields - web development (flask/django), data processing (pandas/scipy/numpy...), data visualization (matplotlib), neural networks (tensorflow-keras, scikit).
